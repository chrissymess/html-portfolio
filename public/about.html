<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hi, my name is Christina</h2>
<p>I've only just started learning how to code. Why? I'm a product designer and I want to learn more about what is involved in creating the designs I produce!</p>
<p>In my free time, I love exercising, whether that be running or the gym, and learning how to play the piano.</p>
